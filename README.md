#### Keywords

-   Capture key aspects of the idea

#### Platforms(s)

-   List each

#### Target Player Exerience

What kind of experience do you want the player to have with your game? Are they going to have to outsmart their enemies, explore a new world. Do not list the game’s mechanics or features and do not use the word “UNIQUE”.

#### Core Diagram

1.  Core Mechaninc

    -   The core mechanic in a game will usually be the purposeful interaction that occurs the most frequently. In a platforming game, this is usually jumping. In a shooter, it is usually shooting. In a racing game, it will be driving. Another way to determine the core mechanic is, if without it, you wouldn’t be able to play the game at all.

2.  Secondary Mechancis

    -   The secondary mechanics are the interactions that happen less frequently. They could even be layered out from more frequent to least frequent.
    -   List each


3.  Progression

    -   Progression systems form the mechanical envelope of the game, being the source of change within the game system at a holistic level.

4.  Narrative

    -   The Narrative layer is the outer most layer that puts all the inner layers within it into context.

#### Minimal Viable Interaction

What will be in your MVI? What will the player be able to do? Why only this? We may have a back and forth on this because this will be what I use to measure if you delivered an MVI.

#### References

Pease add a short description of how this is relevant to your game (mechanic, art, theme, etc.). There is no limit to how many references you can have.
