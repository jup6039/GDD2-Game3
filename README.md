#### Target Player Exerience

Too Many Limes is a platforming puzzle-cooking game. Throughout the game, players will be tasked with completing a certain recipe by gathering the required ingredients, all while trying to keep the many, many limes from getting in.

#### Core Diagram

1.  Core Mechanic

    -   Getting ingredients for a given recipe while avoiding limes

2.  Secondary Mechanics

    -   Duplicate ingredients that are limes
    -   Platforming/Puzzle levels

3.  Progression

    -   The game starts out rather normally, with a regular kitchen and an average amount of limes
    -   The first level introduces you to the basic mechanics of picking up the ingredients you need and adding them to the pot in the center of the kitchen
    -   As it progresses, the levels start to get more chaotic and crazy, adding in strange platforming segments, false ingredients to lead you astray, and, of course, FAR more limes

4.  Narrative

    -   You are a chef working at a somewhat popular restaurant. However, there was an error in your latest shipment of cooking supplies: all of the ingredients were turned into limes! Now you have to deal with the many limes trying to interfere with your work.

#### Minimal Viable Interaction

What will be in your MVI? What will the player be able to do? Why only this? We may have a back and forth on this because this will be what I use to measure if you delivered an MVI.
