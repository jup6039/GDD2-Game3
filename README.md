#### Target Player Exerience

Too Many Limes is a platforming puzzle-cooking game. Throughout the game, players will be tasked with completing a certain recipe by gathering the required ingredients, all while trying to keep the many, many limes from getting in.

#### Core Diagram

1.  Core Mechanic

    -   Getting ingredients for a given recipe while avoiding limes

2.  Secondary Mechanics

    -   Duplicate ingredients that are limes
    -   Platforming/Puzzle levels

3.  Progression

    -   The game starts out rather normally, with a regular kitchen and an average amount of limes
    -   The first level introduces you to the basic mechanics of picking up the ingredients you need and adding them to the pot in the center of the kitchen
    -   As it progresses, the levels start to get more chaotic and crazy, adding in strange platforming segments, false ingredients to lead you astray, and, of course, FAR more limes

4.  Narrative

    -   You are a chef working at a somewhat popular restaurant. However, there was an error in your latest shipment of cooking supplies: all of the ingredients were turned into limes! Now you have to deal with the many limes trying to interfere with your work.

#### Minimal Viable Interaction

For the MVI, we will be creating the first level or two of the game. This will allow us to create the base mechanics required for this game, such as picking up objects, spawning the correct ingredients, and determining whether you are adding the correct ingredients or not.

2.   Mother Simulator

    -   Mother Simulator is a first-person game where you are a mother tasked with taking care of your baby. The game takes a turn when it starts adding bizarre side mechanics that attempt to interfere with your regular tasks, such as aliens that abduct your baby if you leave it alone for too long. This game serves as an inspiration for the side mechanics we want to put in this game to add variety and wackiness to the game.
